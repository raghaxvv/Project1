# Household Electric Power Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes the **“Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Data Set”** from the **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household at one-minute intervals over nearly four years.

## Dataset Overview

- **Size**: 20 MB
- **Total Rows**: 2,075,259
- **Variables**:
  - Date (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Time (hh:mm:ss)
  - Global Active Power (kilowatts)
  - Global Reactive Power (kilowatts)
  - Voltage (volts)
  - Global Intensity (amperes)
  - Sub Metering 1, 2, and 3 (watt-hours)

### Focus Dates

Data is filtered for **2007-02-01** and **2007-02-02**.

## Project Objective

To examine household energy usage patterns over the specified two-day period using various plots generated in R.

## Included Plots

1. Histogram of Global Active Power
2. Voltage over Time
3. Energy Sub Metering
4. Global Active Power vs. Global Reactive Power
